# Amiibo Viewer
This is a site used for viewing Amiibo for your collection. You can sort by name or by series.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site uses the Amiibo API to fetch the data that populates the DOM. I tried to go with an authentic looking design for a Nintendo product when making this site, and I think that it turned out nicely. The ability to sort by series or by name is a mixture of filtering and using the proper query parameters. Each of the items in the response object are put through a function that takes the proper information and creates a card that is appended to the DOM.

## Optimizations

I would like to add authentication to this site as well as collections. I collect amiibo, and I would like for it to keep track of my collection by letting me know which one's I need and showing me the ones that I have. I was also planning on adding another API that pulls the recently sold price on ebay to find out the rough value of your collection.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great opportunity to learn about creating elements in a format that could be rendered nicely to the DOM and having a CSS class apply styles in a modular fashion. I also found that making the toggle between "name" and "series" a fun way to learn about how labels can be used in unexpected ways.
